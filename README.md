## Bakery Sales Analysis and Prediction

### Overview
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for analyzing daily sales data from two bakery stores. The data includes sales records of various bakery products over a year, alongside predictions generated by an AI model. The analysis covers data loading, cleaning, transformation, and exploration using pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries.

### Data Description
The dataset (`data.csv`) includes:
- **date**: Date of the sales record
- **item_id**: Unique identifier of the product
- **name**: Name of the product
- **unit_price**: Price per unit in Euros
- **waste**: Quantity of product wasted daily
- **sales_qntty**: Quantity of product sold daily
- **category**: Product category
- **store_name**: Name of the bakery store
- **prediction**: AI prediction of daily sales quantity

### Key Features
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loaded CSV data using pandas, converted data types, and handled missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzed total sales, waste, and predictions for each store and product.
- **Visualizations**: Plotted line charts to compare actual sales and AI predictions.
- **Modeling**: Developed a Linear Regression model to predict sales of a specific product (`item_id = 102`) at store two, evaluated using RMSE and RÂ² score.
- **Seasonal Analysis**: Compared product sales between winter and summer months.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculated L2 error of the model on test data (`2021-04` to `2021-05`).

### Results and Insights
- Identified days with highest sales for specific products.
- Determined days each store is open based on available data.
- Estimated potential cost savings if AI predictions were utilized.

### Dependencies
- pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn


# Bakery Sales Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains the Power BI dashboard for analyzing bakery sales data from two stores over the span of a year. The dashboard provides detailed insights into sales performance, waste management, and prediction accuracy, helping to optimize operations and reduce losses.

## Dashboard Features

### Total Metrics
- **Total Predicted Quantity**: Displays the total quantity of items predicted to be sold by the AI model.
- **Total Sales in Quantity**: Shows the actual total quantity of items sold.
- **Total Waste Quantity**: Indicates the total quantity of items that went to waste.
- **Total Loss in Euros**: Displays the total financial loss due to wasted items.

### Detailed Analysis
- **Total Sold Quantity by Name**: A pie chart breaking down the total sold quantity by item name, helping to identify the best-selling products.
- **Total Sold Quantities by Days**: A line chart showing the quantity sold each day of the week, highlighting peak sales days.
- **Total Waste by Days**: A bar chart indicating the waste quantity for each day of the week, allowing for better waste management strategies.

### Comparative Insights
- **Sales vs Prediction**: A bar chart comparing actual sales quantities with AI predictions for each month, showcasing prediction accuracy.
- **Total Loss in Euros by Month**: A line chart showing the financial loss due to waste for each month, identifying trends and areas for improvement.
- **Sales by Category**: A bar chart displaying sales quantities categorized by product type, providing insights into category performance.

### Filters and Slicers
- **Store Name Filter**: Allows selection between two bakery stores to compare performance.
- **Item Name Filter**: Provides the option to view data for specific products.
- **Time Duration Filter**: Enables analysis over a selected date range.
- **Season Filter**: Allows seasonal analysis to understand the impact on sales and waste.
